<h1>Special Members</h1>

Starting from C++11 <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/member_functions#Special_member_functions">special members</a> (e.g. move constructor, move assignment, etc..) are provided by the compiler under particular circumstances<br/><br/>

Notice that defaulted members can still reference deleted members or <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/default_constructor#Deleted_implicitly-declared_default_constructor">fall under other deleting conditions</a> and thus be in turn marked as deleted.
