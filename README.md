# KBase
KBase is a knowledge base with a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) backend and a [KNode](https://github.com/marcodiiga/knode)-based frontend.

KBase requires a MySQL database and it is configured to work on [OpenShift RHC](https://www.openshift.com/) gears.

A live version **[may be reached here](http://marcodiiga.github.io/kbase/)**

*Notice: if gears have gone idle it might take up to 2 minutes to initialize the kbase entirely. If the amount of free requests has been
exceeded it might take some time before all systems will be back online.*
